A project from the [Blavatnik School of Government](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk). More information is available on the school's website: https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker

Systematic information on which governments have taken which measures, and when, can help decision-makers and citizens understand the robustness of governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. The OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, scores the stringency of such measures, and aggregates these scores into a common Stringency Index.
