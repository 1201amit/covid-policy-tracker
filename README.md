A project from the [Blavatnik School of Government](www.bsg.ox.ac.uk). More information is available on the school's website: https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker

Systematic information on which governments have taken which measures, and when, can help decision-makers and citizens understand the robustness of governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. The OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, scores the stringency of such measures, and aggregates these scores into a common Stringency Index.

## The database

OxCGRT collects publicly available information on 13 indicators of government response (S1-S13). Seven of the indicators (S1-S7) record policies around containment and social isoaltion, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. These are recorded on an ordinal scale that represents the level of strictness of the policy. Two of the indicators (S12 and S13) represent policies around testing and contact tracing, also recorded on an ordinal scale. The remainder (S8-S11) are financial indicators such as fiscal or monetary measures.

Six of the indicators (S1-S6) also have a flag for whether they are targeted to a specific geographical region (isgeneral=0) or whether they are a "general" policy that is applied countrywide (isgeneral=1).

  S1 - school closures (plus targeted/genral flag)
  S2 - workplace closures (plus targeted/gemeral flag)
  S3 - cancellation of public events (plus targeted/general flag)
  S4 - public transport closures (plus targeted/general flag)
  S5 - public information campaign (plus targeted/general flag)
  S6 - restrictions on domestic/internal movement (plus targeted/general flag)
  S7 - restrictions on international travel
  S8 - economic stimulus measures
  S9 - central bank interest rate
  S10 - emergency investment in healthcare
  S11 - investment in vaccines
  S12 - testing policy
  S13 - contact tracing policy
